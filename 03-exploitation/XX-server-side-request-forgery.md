## Find SSRF 

Look for URLs or paths passed as parameters.  

Examples:  
* `https://domain.com/param?server=https://api.domain.com/param2`
* `https://domain.com/param?server=api`
* `https://domain.com/param?path=/api/user`

## Blind SSRF

Use an external HTTP logging tool like [requestbin.com](https://requestbin.com).
