## Mutating

config file
```bash
/etc/john/john.conf
```

Modify the config file
```
# Add two numbers to the end of each password
$[0-9]$[0-9]
```

```bash
john --wordlist=megacorp-cewl.txt --rules --stdout > mutated.txt
```

## Hash attacks

brute force (all)
```bash
john <file-with-hashes>
```

using wordlist
```bash
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt <file-with-hashes>
```

applying rules
**word mangling rules** are used to modify or "mangle" **words** producing other likely passwords
```bash
john --rules --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt <file-with-hashes>
```

### Rules

KoreLogic used a variety of custom rules to generate the passwords.
[KoreLogic John the Ripper Rules](https://contest-2010.korelogic.com/rules.html)

```bash
cAz "19[0-9][0-9]"
```

```bash
Az "19[0-9][0-9]"
```

### SSH key encryption (passphrase)

```bash
ssh2john <keyfile> > <output>
```

convert to john readable format

```bash
./sshng2john.py <keyfile> > <output>
```

crack it
```bash
