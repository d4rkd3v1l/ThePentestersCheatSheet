* [PortSwigger - Web Security Academy - Testing for WebSockets security vulnerabilities](https://portswigger.net/web-security/information-disclosure)  

## How to test

* Fuzzing  
* Burp scanner (or a similar tool/scanner)  
* Burp's engagement tools (Search, Find comments, Discover content)  
* Engineering informative responses (e.g. submitting an invalid value to cause a detailed error message or stack trace show up)  

## Common sources of information disclosure

* `/robots.txt` and `/sitemap.xml`  
* Directory listings  
* Developer comments  
* (Verbose) error messages (e.g. database table or column names)  
* Debug output  
* User account pages  
* Source code from backups (e.g. login.php\~)  
* Insecure configuration (e.g. HTTP `TRACE` method)  
* Version control history (e.g. access to `.git` folder)
